### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Matt and I am an aspiring Junior Software Engineer from the south of England.
I am coming to the end of my software engineering bootcamp with HyperionDev, I have passed my final capstone project, and have an average grade of 99%.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finishing all my portfolio projects and adding OOP to ones previously completed. This is to create a portfolio, to aid my job search, and to land my first tech job!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning OOP in Python, creating functioning programs using objects, classes and methods.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He / Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I used to play guitar in an 80's style rock band and my hair was halfway down my back!ðŸ˜‚
